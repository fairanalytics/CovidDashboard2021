## Motivation :
I track covid situtations on daily basis , sometimes even hourly . 
And one day I thought, I am a data scientist and can have access live public data, why not providing a useful solution .  


## Data source : 
The application relies fully on **Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE)** data, available in the following link : 
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases

## Dashboard : 

The dashboard diplays a bunch of infromation on a country level with a possibility to visualize on different aggretions . 

## Live Demo :

https://fair-analytics.shinyapps.io/covidfairanalytics/

## what makes it happen : 

Several packages were involved to make this project a real dashboard, below are the elements : 
* shiny/shindashboard/shindashboardPlus : without them the UI would look like a R file .
* Tidyverse Family and purrr : my favourite packages to make every complex dataset look like "mtcars" . 
* golem : as sexy as that you would not find, it enables to organize the dashboard as a software and package and gives it an entreprise framework.

## Usage and Installation
In order to run the app in your local machine, follow the steps below : 

- install.packages("remotes") 
We need Dev version of shinydashboardPlus
- remotes::install_github("RinteRface/shinydashboardPlus")

Then simply install the Covid Dashboard as a package .

- remotes::install_github("fairanalytics/CovidDashboard2021")

Successfully installed ? run the following command line in your IDE : 

* **CovidFairAnalytics::run_app()**

## Issues :
